# expandedForm
Coding challenge that groups and expands numbers in their given place value order. eg. 10234 = 1 x "10000", 2 x "100", 3 x "10, 4 x "1".

* Please note: This in a JavaScript file and needs to be run in the browser: "CNTRL + ALT + J" or in the text editor using node.js .
* You can test your own values: Call the function and input your desired value that you would like to expand.
* Example: expandedForm(), input "105678" as expandedForm(10678), output should return as "10 000" + "600" + "70" + "8".

<b>In order to use the code in this repo, please open the JS file in a text editor of your choice.</b>
<p>I use Visual Studio Code as my prefered text editor</p>
<p> To test/run the code, simply navigate to the file in the teminal and type: "node expandedForm.js".</p>
<p>Code can also be debugged in the text editor by running: "Start Debugging". The output will be displayed in the debug console.</p>
